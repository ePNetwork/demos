The S8 Active was announced on 8 August 2017 and is exclusive to certain U.S. cellular carriers.</p>
        <p>The S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over the S7 line, including larger screens with a taller <a href="/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a> and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, <a href="/wiki/Iris_recognition" title="Iris recognition">iris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Face_recognition" class="mw-redirect" title="Face recognition">face recognition</a>, a new suite of <a href="/wiki/Virtual_assistant_(artificial_intelligence)" title="Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)">virtual assistant</a> features known as <a href="/wiki/Bixby_(voice_assistant)" class="mw-redirect" title="Bixby (voice assistant)">Bixby</a> (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), and <a href="/wiki/Samsung_DeX" title="Samsung DeX">Samsung DeX</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Docking_station" title="Docking station">docking station</a> accessory that allows the phones to be used with a <a href="/wiki/Desktop_environment" title="Desktop environment">desktop interface</a> with keyboard and mouse input support.

        <p>The S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera and for poor biometric options for unlocking the phone. Videos published after the phones' release have proven that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.</p>
        <p>The S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.</p>

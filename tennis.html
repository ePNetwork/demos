<p>Further, the patenting of the first <a href="/wiki/Lawn_mower" title="Lawn mower">lawn mower</a> in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, worldwide, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
